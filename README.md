## 📌 Featured Projects

### 🎨 Detecting Dominant Colors in an Image  
- The system is capable of grouping image pixels based on color similarity and presenting the results as a representative palette of dominant colors.
- The image preprocessing process (conversion to RGB, resizing, and normalization) improves processing efficiency and the accuracy of color extraction.
- The implementation of a web-based interface using Gradio simplifies user interaction for uploading images, setting the number of dominant colors, and displaying analysis results visually.
- Interactive features such as pixel marking based on selected colors and a palette download option enhance the system’s functionality and user experience.

### 🔷 Geographic Information System Implementation for Mapping the Distribution of Low-Income Communities (Case Study: Tebing Tinggi Okura Village)  
- The implementation of GIS helps the village administration make strategic decisions, particularly in determining priority recipients of social assistance programs such as the Family Hope Program (PKH).
- The displayed data is derived from georeferencing and the processing of poverty data, including the head of the household’s name, number of family members, group, address, and house photo.
- The system allows administrators to add, edit, and delete data dynamically through a web-based interface.
- The map visualization provides a clear representation of poverty distribution, supporting the effectiveness of poverty alleviation programs in the area.

### 🤖 NLP - Sustainability Product Classifier(PREDICTID Dataset)  
- The system is capable of analyzing and classifying product reviews into four categories: Wasteful Packaging, Non-Durable Products, Durable and High-Quality Products, and Neutral.
- The project stages include text cleaning, preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization), automatic keyword-based labeling, and feature extraction using TF-IDF.
- The three main algorithms used for classification are Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Linear SVC, with Linear SVC achieving the highest accuracy of 97.46%.
- The system is also integrated into a Flask-based website, allowing users to input product reviews directly and obtain classification results automatically.
- The project results show that NLP is effective in understanding sustainability-related contexts in consumer reviews, making it useful for increasing awareness of responsible consumption.
